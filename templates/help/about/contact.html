		The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for all the summer beyond the 
		panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, 
		hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding 
		only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to 
		wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured 
		rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it 
		borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak 
		after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.<br/><br/>

		"And this," said the Director opening the door, "is the Fertilizing Room."<br/><br/>
		
		Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as the Director of Hatcheries 
		and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, 
		soliloquizing hum or whistle, of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very 
		young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director's heels. Each of them 
		carried a notebook, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight from 
		the horse's mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D. H. C. for Central London always made a point of 
		personally conducting his new students round the various departments.<br/><br/>

		"Just to give you a general idea," he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general 
		idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently--though as little of one, if they 
		were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, 
		make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers 
		but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.<br/><br/>
