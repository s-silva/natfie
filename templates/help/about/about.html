			<p>Well, it's - letting things evolve. There's a process of tweaking</p>

		<div class='helpaboutti'><h1>How Everything Started</h1>
			<p>The first draft for the site was made around the last two weeks</p>
			<p>of September, 2012. It was basically about a network of</p>
			<p>people with two location identities - a virtual and a physical one.</p>
			<p>The basic idea was to allow people to have random and quick</p>
			<p>meetups probably according to their interests.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='helpaboutti'><h1>Since Then?</h1>
			<p>Things went pretty much all over the social networking</p>
			<p>and blogging world since then. The initial goal of project became</p>
			<p>'just another feature' after a while. Yet, that 'awhile' was needed</p>
			<p>to figure out the basic design of the site.</p>
